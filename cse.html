        <h2>Once, Goddess Parvati, while bathing, created a boy out of the turmeric paste she used for cleansing. She breathed life into the boy and asked him to guard the entrance while she took a bath. Meanwhile, Lord Shiva returned home but was stopped by the young boy. Not recognizing him as his son, Shiva became furious and severed the boy's head in a fit of rage.

            When Parvati realized what had happened, she was devastated. To console her, Lord Shiva promised to bring the boy back to life. He instructed his followers (Ganas) to bring the head of the first living being they found, which happened to be an elephant. Lord Shiva then placed the elephant's head on the boy's body, bringing him back to life.
            
            This boy with an elephant head came to be known as Ganesha, and he is revered as the remover of obstacles and the lord of wisdom and prosperity. This story highlights the importance of Lord Ganesha and his association with new beginnings and overcoming obstacles.
